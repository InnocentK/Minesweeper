# Minesweeper
This is a simplified version of the Minesweeper puzzle game. The goal of the game is to determine the location of all of the board’s “mines,” using clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field. In this version, the game is won if all of the mines are correctly flagged (and no mines are incorrectly flagged)
